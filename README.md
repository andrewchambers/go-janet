# Go Janet

A go port of the janet programming language.

## Project goals

This project aims to be a compatible port of https://janet-lang.org/ to Go.
We do not want to cause any fragmentation of they janet ecosystem, just provide seamless
Go interop.

When porting do *not* add any creativity other than matching go conventions,
we want to be as close to the original as possible in code structure so that upgrades
can be done by comparing the C code to the go code.

The current port target is 1.5.1, once this is more or less complete, we can bring the
code up to date with the rest of janet.
